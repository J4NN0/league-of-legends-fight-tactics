  description: Enemies who fall before Viego become wraiths. By attacking a wraith,
    Viego temporarily seizes control of the dead enemy's body, healing for a percentage
    of his target's max health and gaining access to their basic abilities and items.
    He replaces their Ultimate with a free cast of his own.
