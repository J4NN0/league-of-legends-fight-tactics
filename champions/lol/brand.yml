  description: Brand's spells light his targets ablaze, dealing damage over 4 seconds,
    stacking up to 3 times. If Brand kills an enemy while it is ablaze he regains
    mana. When Blaze reaches max stacks on a Champion or large monster, it becomes
    unstable. It detonates in 2 seconds, applying spell effects and dealing massive
    damage in an area around the victim.
