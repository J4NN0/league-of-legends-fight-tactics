  description: Each time Zac hits an enemy with an ability, he sheds a chunk of himself
    that can be reabsorbed to restore Health. Upon taking fatal damage, Zac splits
    into 4 bloblets that attempt to recombine. If any bloblets remain, he will revive
    with an amount of Health depending on the Health of the surviving bloblets. Each
    bloblet has a percentage of Zac's maximum Health, Armor and Magic Resistance.
    This ability has a 5 minute cooldown.
