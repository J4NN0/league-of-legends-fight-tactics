  description: 'Aphelios wields 5 Lunari Weapons made by his sister Alune. He has
    access to two at a time: one main-hand and one off-hand. Each weapon has a unique
    Basic Attack and Ability. Attacks and abilities consume a weapon''s ammo. When
    out of ammo, Aphelios discards the weapon and Alune summons the next of the 5. '
