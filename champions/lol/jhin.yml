  description: Jhin's hand cannon, Whisper, is a precise instrument designed to deal
    superior damage. It fires at a fixed rate and carries only four shots. Jhin imbues
    the final bullet with dark magics to critically strike and deal bonus execute
    damage. Whenever Whisper crits, it inspires Jhin with a burst of Move Speed.
