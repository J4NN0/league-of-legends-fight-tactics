  description: Braum's basic attacks apply Concussive Blows. Once the first stack
    is applied, <font color='#FFF673'>ally</font> basic attacks also stack Concussive
    Blows. <br><br>Upon reaching 4 stacks, the target is stunned and takes magic damage.
    For the next few seconds they cannot receive new stacks, but take bonus magic
    damage from Braum's attacks.
