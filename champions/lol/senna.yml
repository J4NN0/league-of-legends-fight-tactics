  description: When units die near Senna, their souls are periodically trapped by
    the Black Mist. Senna can attack these souls to free them, absorbing the Mist
    that held them in death. Mist fuels her Relic Cannon's power with increased Attack
    Damage, Attack Range, and Critical Strike Chance. <br><br>Attacks from Senna's
    Relic Cannon take longer to fire, deal bonus damage, and briefly grant her a portion
    of her target's Move Speed.
